# an opperator is the character or symbol that tells a computer what to do with a value or an operant
#types of opperators in python are:
#aritematic opperators
#logical operators
#bitwise operators
#assignment operators
#special operators
#comparison operators
num1,num2 = 30,20
print(num1+num2) #add num1 and num2
print(num1-num2) #subtract num1 and num2
print(num1*num2) # add zero
print(num1/num2) #the answer will have a decimal point
print(num1//num2) #eliminate the decimal points
print(num2**num1) #add on many zero
print(num2%num1) #dividing and getting the remainder
print(num1%num2)
